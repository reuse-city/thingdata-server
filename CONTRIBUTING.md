## License and Copyright

By contributing to ThingData Server, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0). 

The AGPL-3.0 is a copyleft license that requires anyone who distributes or modifies your code, or who runs it on a network server, to make the complete source code available under the same license. This means:

1. If someone modifies ThingData Server and shares it, they must share the modified source code.
2. If someone runs a modified version of ThingData Server on a server, they must make their modifications available to users of that server.
3. All derivative works must also be licensed under AGPL-3.0.

We chose this license because:
- We believe repair knowledge should be freely accessible
- We want to ensure that improvements to this platform remain open source
- We want to foster a community of sharing and collaboration

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and feature requests. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.
